# Question 1

## First Part

In the chunk below, I will load the dataset, clean names, and get rid of
unwanted rows.

``` r
trash_df = 
  read_excel("Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
             range = "A2:N408") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  filter(dumpster >= 1) %>% 
  mutate(
    sports_balls = round(sports_balls, digits = 0),
    sports_balls = as.integer(sports_balls)
  )
view(trash_df)
```

## Second Part

Let us first load and clean precipitation data from year 2018 as well as
add a new variable year.

``` r
prec_2018 =
  read_excel("Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
             range = "A2:B14", sheet = 5) %>%
  mutate(year = 2018) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names()
view(prec_2018)
```

Next, I will load and clean precipitation data from 2017 as well as
create a new variable year.

``` r
prec_2017 = 
  read_excel("Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
             range = "A2:B14", sheet = 6) %>% 
  mutate(year = 2017) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names()
view(prec_2017)
```

Finally, I will combine both the 2018 and 2017 precipitation dataframes
and convert month to character variable.

``` r
prec_df = 
  left_join(prec_2017, prec_2018, by = "month") %>% 
  mutate(
    month = as.numeric(month),
    month = month.name[month])
view(prec_df)
```

The Mr. Trash Wheel is a dataset comprised of **14** variables and
**344** observations. And the key variables are **dumpster**, **month**,
**year** and **sports balls**.

Precipitation dataframes for years 2018 and 2017, both have **3**
variables and **12** observations. Lastly, when both precipitation
dataframes are combined, the resulting dataframe is comprised of **5**
variables and **12** observations. Key variables for the combined
dataframe are **month** and **year**.

The total precipitation for year 2018 was **70.33**.

``` r
med = 
  trash_df %>% 
  filter(year == "2017") %>% 
  select(year, sports_balls)
```

So, the median number of sports balls for year 2017 was **8**.

# Question 2

The Chunk below will load the dataset ‘pols\_month’, clean it, and break
up the variable ‘mon’ into variables year, month, and day. It will also
replace month number with month name, and finally, create a president
variable with values gop and dem.

``` r
pols_df = 
  read_excel("fivethirtyeight_datasets/pols-month.xlsx") %>% 
  separate(col = mon, into = c("year", "month", "day")) %>% 
   mutate(
    month = as.numeric(month),
    month = month.abb[month],
    president = recode(prez_gop, `0` = "dem", `1` = "gop")) %>% 
  select(-c(prez_gop, prez_dem, day)) %>%
view(pols_df)
```

The following chunk will load, clean the dataset ‘snp’, and variables
will be arranged in a way to make it easier for me to join datasets.

``` r
snp_df1 = 
  read_csv("fivethirtyeight_datasets/snp.csv") %>%   
  separate(col = date, into = c("day", "month", "year")) %>% 
  mutate(
    month = as.numeric(month),
    month = month.abb[month]) %>% 
  select(-day)
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   date = col_character(),
    ##   close = col_double()
    ## )

``` r
snp_df = snp_df1[,c(2,1,3)]
view(snp_df)
```

The chunk below will load and clean the unemployment dataset, and
finally, tidy it with a goal of being able to merge it with the two
datasets above.

``` r
jobless_df = 
  read_csv("fivethirtyeight_datasets/unemployment.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    jan:dec,
    names_to = "month",
    values_to = "day") %>% 
  select(-day)
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   Year = col_double(),
    ##   Jan = col_double(),
    ##   Feb = col_double(),
    ##   Mar = col_double(),
    ##   Apr = col_double(),
    ##   May = col_double(),
    ##   Jun = col_double(),
    ##   Jul = col_double(),
    ##   Aug = col_double(),
    ##   Sep = col_double(),
    ##   Oct = col_double(),
    ##   Nov = col_double(),
    ##   Dec = col_double()
    ## )

``` r
# how do you represent day as integer. not possible so far
view(jobless_df)
```

Let us first join pols\_df and snp\_df.

``` r
df = 
  left_join(snp_df, pols_df, by = c("month", "year")) %>% 
              mutate(
                year = as.numeric(year)
)
view(df)
```

Next, we will join the new dataframe created in the above chunk with the
jobless/unemployment dataframe.

``` r
master_df = 
  left_join(df, jobless_df, by = c("month", "year"))
view(master_df)
```

For the pols-month (later named pols\_df), the number of variables and
observations did not change when the original dataset is compared to the
final (9 variables and 822 observations). Range of years is **1947,
2015**. Names of key variables are month, year, and president.

For the snp dataframe, I started with 2 columns and 787 observations and
ended up with a total of **3** variables and **787** observations. Range
of years is **1950, 2015**. And finally, key variables are year and
month.

For the unemployment (jobless\_df) dataframe, I started with 13
variables and 68 observations and ended up with **2** variables and
**816** observations. Range of years is **1948, 2015** and key variables
are year and month.

For the master dataframe (master\_df), the resulting variables are
**10** and observations are **787**. Range of years are **1950, 2015**.
Key variables being month, year, and
president.

# Question 3

``` r
# Loading and cleaning the dataset as well as getting rid of rows which appears twice.
popnames_df = 
  read_csv("Popular_Baby_Names.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  distinct() %>%
  mutate(
    gender = str_to_lower(gender),
    ethnicity = str_to_lower(ethnicity),
    childs_first_name = str_to_lower(childs_first_name)) %>% 
  mutate(
    ethnicity = recode(ethnicity, "asian and paci" = "asian and pacific islander"),
    ethnicity = recode(ethnicity, "black non hisp" = "black non hispanic"),
    ethnicity = recode(ethnicity, "white non hisp" = "white non hispanic")
  )
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   `Year of Birth` = col_double(),
    ##   Gender = col_character(),
    ##   Ethnicity = col_character(),
    ##   `Child's First Name` = col_character(),
    ##   Count = col_double(),
    ##   Rank = col_double()
    ## )

``` r
view(popnames_df)
```

Let’s create a table using **tibble** to showcase the frequency of the
name **Olivia** over time among female subjects.

``` r
olivia_as_name = 
  popnames_df %>% 
  filter(childs_first_name == "olivia") %>% 
  select(-count, -gender) %>% 
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = "year_of_birth",
    values_from = "rank"
  )
view(olivia_as_name)
```

Next, I will produce a nice, readable tibble representing popular male’s
name by ethnicity and year of birth.

``` r
pop_male_name = 
  popnames_df %>% 
  filter(rank == "1", gender == "male") %>% 
  select(-gender, -count) %>% 
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = "year_of_birth",
    values_from = "childs_first_name"
  )
view(pop_male_name)
```

Finally, I will produce a scatterplot for white non hispanic male born
in 2016, showing the number of children with a name against the rank in
popularity of that name.

``` r
scatter_male = 
  popnames_df %>% 
  filter(gender == "male", 
         ethnicity == "white non hispanic", 
         year_of_birth == "2016") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = rank, y = count)) +
           geom_point()
scatter_male
```
