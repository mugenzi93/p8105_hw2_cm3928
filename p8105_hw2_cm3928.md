# Question 1

In the chunk below, I will load the dataset, clean names, and get rid of
unwanted rows.

``` r
trash_df = 
  read_excel("HealthyHarborWaterWheelTotals2018-7-28.xlsx",
             range = "A2:N338") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  filter(dumpster >= 1)
view(trash_df)
```

The chunk below converts the variable sports\_balls from decimal to
integer.

``` r
sports_b = round(pull(trash_df, sports_balls), digits = 2)
sports_int = as.integer(sports_b)
```
